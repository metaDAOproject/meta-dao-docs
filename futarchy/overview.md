MetaDAO uses a mechanism called futarchy to make its decisions. Futarchy was invented by economist Robin Hanson in 2000 and MetaDAO is the first known instantiation of it.

The basic idea of futarchy is to **give decision-making authority to markets.**

We can demonstrate with an example: a company deciding whether to fire the CEO. A company organized as a futarchy would do the following:

1. Create two markets for the companyâ€™s stock: one â€˜retain CEOâ€™ market and one â€˜fire CEOâ€™ market.
2. Allow investors to trade in these markets for some time period, such as 10 days.
3. After the time period has elapsed, look at prices of the companyâ€™s stock in both markets. If 'retain CEO' stock is more valuable, retain the CEO and revert all trades in the â€˜fire CEOâ€™ market. If â€˜fire CEOâ€™ stock is more valuable, fire the CEO and revert all trades in the â€˜retain CEO market.â€™

In essence, you allow the market to speculate on what the value of the company _would be_ if the company fired the CEO, and then fire the CEO if the company would be more valuable.

The company can use the same process for any decision. It can have the market speculate on how an action would affect the value of the company and take the action if it would make the company more valuable.
