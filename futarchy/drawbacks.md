# Drawbacks

One of the largest drawbacks of markets is [Keynesian beauty contests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian\_beauty\_contest). In other words, sometimes investors buy what they think others will buy, not what they think the fundamentals support. This is especially evident in crypto markets where many tokens are [reflexively priced](https://www.epsilonmgmt.com/blog/reflexivity/), and have no fundamentals.

However, there are two counter-points to consider.

For one, what weâ€™re searching for is not the Platonic ideal of a governance system, but merely one that is better than the others. Empirically and theoretically, markets appear to be better than other prediction mechanisms.

Secondly, people tend to underestimate the rationality of markets because of the [frequency illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency\_illusion). Normal market conditions are boring and receive little media coverage. Periods of irrationality, such as the [GameStop short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop\_short\_squeeze), receive lots of publicity. So we are predisposed to see markets as more irrational than they are.
