# âš« META

All futarchies need a reference asset whose value they try to maximize, so MetaDAO has META.

To bootstrap the governance process, 10,000 META was airdropped to \~60 wallets. The remaining supply was held by the DAO's treasury.

More META has entered the circulating supply through successful governance proposals. This includes:

* **Proposal 4**: issued 400 META to fund the creation of an AMM with a TWAP
* **Proposal 5**: sold 3,100 META for $24.2 per META and allocated 1,000 META to a [Meteora liquidity pool](https://app.meteora.ag/pools/6t2CdBC26q9tj6jBwPzzFZogtjX8mtmVHUmAFmjAhMSn)
* **Proposal 10**: issued 342 META to fund the creation of Futarchy-as-a-Service

The [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/metadaohogs/themetadao) provides an up-to-date circulating supply of META.
