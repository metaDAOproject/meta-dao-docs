# üåè Overview

MetaDAO is a live instance of futarchy that uses [META](https://app.gitbook.com/o/OGoMYC58rlfeRdt3mSG4/s/VrfQQGUqcuQR22v42NnC/\~/changes/42/metadao/meta) as its reference asset.

MetaDAO has one live product - [vota.fi](https://vota.fi/) - and is currently building a product that would allow other DAOs to use futarchy.

Although MetaDAO is itself not a legal entity - it's a cybernetic entity orchestrated by programs stored on the Solana blockchain - it controls MetaDAO LLC, which is a DAO LLC registered with the Marshall Islands. MetaDAO LLC retains legal ownership over the domain names, codebases, and social media accounts associated with MetaDAO.
