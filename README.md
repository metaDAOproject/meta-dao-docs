# Introduction

MetaDAO is the world's first market-governed organization.

Most of today's organizations are captured by politics. They make decisions based on what's good for those in power, not what's good for the organization as a whole.

MetaDAO gets around these issues by using futarchy, a system where markets make decisions.
