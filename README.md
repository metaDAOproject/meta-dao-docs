# Introduction

MetaDAO is a new kind of organization. It uses [futarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy), a system where markets make decisions. As such, it sidesteps existing challenges with governance such as [voter apathy](https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/voter-apathy) and [political capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking).
