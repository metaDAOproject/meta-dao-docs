# The Meta-DAO

The Meta-DAO is a new cybernetic institution managed by programs stored on [the Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/). Instead of [token-voting](https://acceleratedcapital.substack.com/i/36799446/ii-token-based-quorum-voting) or [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid\_democracy), the Meta-DAO uses [futarchy](https://mason.gmu.edu/\~rhanson/futarchy.html).
