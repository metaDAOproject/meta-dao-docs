description: An organization governed by markets, not politics

# Overview

Today's organizations are failing us. We see this in society, where [democracies fail to represent the preferences of their citizens](https://archive.org/details/gilens\_and\_page\_2014\_-testing\_theories\_of\_american\_politics.doc/mode/2up). We also see this in crypto, where our DAOs are [far from decentralized](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/09/aragon-cancels-planned-community-control-of-200m-treasury-amid-battle-with-activist-investors/) or [optimal](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/defi-project-parrot-puts-fate-of-over-70m-treasury-prt-token-to-vote-1032466776?op=1).

The Meta-DAO is a new kind of organization. It uses [futarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy), a system where markets make decisions. As such, it may sidestep many existing challenges with governance such as [voter apathy](https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/voter-apathy) and [political capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking).
