# The Meta-DAO

The Meta-DAO is the first market-governed organization in the history of human civilization. It uses [futarchy](https://mason.gmu.edu/\~rhanson/futarchy.html), a scheme devised by economist Robin Hanson wherein prediction markets make decisions.

You can participate in the Meta-DAO by:

* **Trading**: since all of the Meta-DAO's important decisions are made by markets, traders play a critical role. You can help the Meta-DAO make better decisions by trading in its futarchic markets.
* **Contributing**: the Meta-DAO depends on people creating and executing on value-additive improvement proposals. Anyone can do so - there is no central Meta-DAO Labs or Meta-DAO Foundation that drives these.
