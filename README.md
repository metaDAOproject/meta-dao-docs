description: An organization governed by markets, not politics

# Overview

Today's DAOs are not decentralized. At the root of the issue is the token-voting model: holders have weak incentives to participate in governance, so they end up either not engaging or blindly following the team.

Enter futarchy, a novel governance mechanism where markets make decisions. In a market, traders have a profit incentive to participate in markets and to correct mispricings. Because of this, markets are empirically better than experts at aggregating information:

* Prediction markets [outperform](https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/666656/azu\_etd\_hr\_2021\_0133\_sip1\_m.pdf?sequence=1) [professional pollsters](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40467652) in predicting elections.
* Commodities futures markets [outperform government forecasts](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40467652) in predicting weather.
* Companies like [Google](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/putting-crowd-wisdom-to-work.html) and [HP](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/44358/1/wp1131.pdf) have used prediction markets to succesfully forecast things like launch dates, printer sales, and the dates of new office openings.
* Famously, while it took the US government more than 5 months to identify the Morton-Thiakol O-Rings as the root cause of the Challenger crash, [the markets had priced it so in Morton-Thiakolâ€™s share price within 14 minutes](http://maloney.people.clemson.edu/855/9.pdf).

The Meta-DAO is the first futarchy. Join us to push the frontier of human civilization!
