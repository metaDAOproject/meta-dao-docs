# Scalability

The careful reader may realize that futarchy doesn’t scale. That is, it’s good for big decisions like whether to fire the CEO, but less so for smaller decisions like whether to fire a division leader because those actions may be too inconsequential to reflect in the share price.

We designed a solution to this problem, which is described [here](https://github.com/metaDAOproject/Manifesto/blob/main/Manifesto.pdf) and [here](https://medium.com/@metaproph3t/from-corporations-to-nations-how-the-meta-dao-is-going-to-change-everything-part-3-16b3880fd86c).

The Meta-DAO doesn't use these mechanics today. But it would be possible to migrate in the future if the market decided it so.
