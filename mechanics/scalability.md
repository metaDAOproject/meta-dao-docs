# Scalability

The careful reader may realize that futarchy doesn’t scale. That is, it’s good for big decisions like whether to fire the CEO, but less so for smaller decisions like whether to fire a division leader because those actions may be too inconsequential to reflect in the share price.

We designed a solution to this problem, which is described [here](https://github.com/metaDAOproject/Manifesto/blob/main/Manifesto.pdf) and [here](https://medium.com/@metaproph3t/from-corporations-to-nations-how-the-meta-dao-is-going-to-change-everything-part-3-16b3880fd86c).

The Meta-DAO will be launched without using these mechanics. But it would be possible to migrate to this design in the future.
