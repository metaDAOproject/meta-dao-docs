# Motivation

### Institutions are the driving force of our existence <a href="#institutions-are-the-driving-force-of-our-existence" id="institutions-are-the-driving-force-of-our-existence"></a>

> _An institution is a humanly devised structure of rules and norms that shape and constrain individual behavior._\

Institutions are _really_ important. By shaping our decisions and actions, they decide whether our societies prosper or falter.

Consider, for example, the difference of livelihood between the average Somali and the average German. In a country where [murder and kidnapping are common](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/somalia-travel-advisory.html/), [42% of the population doesn’t have access to basic drinking water services](https://data.unicef.org/country/som/), and [GDP per capita is only $462](https://data.worldbank.org/country/SO), the average Somali lives in bleak circumstances. The average German, on the other hand, [has access to secondary and tertiary education](https://data.oecd.org/germany.htm#profile-education), lives without the fear of terrorists capturing and plundering their town, and [earns 45,457 Euros per year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/).

At the root of the issue is a difference in institutions. [Germany has strong property rights](https://www.lawyersgermany.com/private-property-laws-in-germany), which[ incentivizes people to produce things and develop their land](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/managing\_the\_economy/property\_rights.html/). [Somalia has weak property rights](https://unhabitat.org/land-property-and-housing-in-somalia), and it hardly seems worth producing things when [the local militants will extract away all of your profits](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54690561). Germany is a democracy where political leaders must retain the support of their constituents. Somalia is an anarchy where power is won by brute force. Institutions are the source of both Somalia’s problems and Germany’s comparative abundance.

### Our institutions are failing us <a href="#our-institutions-are-failing-us" id="our-institutions-are-failing-us"></a>

Still, the comparatively superior institutions of the West are far from perfect. For example, because [the incentive to research political candidates is low](http://www.ralphmerkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf), [so-called democracies function more like plutocracies](https://archive.org/details/gilens\_and\_page\_2014\_-testing\_theories\_of\_american\_politics.doc/mode/2up). Because [economies don’t reward the creation or maintenance](https://www.amazon.com/Logic-Collective-Action-Printing-Appendix/dp/0674537513) of [public goods](https://metaproph3t.github.io/posts/public\_goods.html), [not enough time or resources goes to creating and maintaining them](https://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art\_tragedy\_of\_the\_commons.html). And although corporations are generally painted as rational and profit-maximizing, [empirical research](https://hbr.org/1990/05/ceo-incentives-its-not-how-much-you-pay-but-how) shows that boards of directors and managers often have very different incentives than their shareholders.

This problem is even more severe in crypto and DAOs. We have [projects that sell DAO tooling but can't themselves adopt DAOs](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/05/aragon-fires-back-at-activist-investors-in-early-stages-of-governance-fight/), [teams looting their project's treasury](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/21/defi-project-parrot-puts-fate-of-over-70m-treasury-prt-token-to-vote/),  and abysmal governance participation.
