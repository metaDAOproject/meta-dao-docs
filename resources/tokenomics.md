# Tokenomics

The Meta-DAO was launched with an airdrop of 10,000 META to 60 people. So far, an additional 4,530 META have been issued, corresponding to:

* 3,100 META sold for $24.2 per META for a total of $75,000 to the treasury
* 1,000 META allocated to a [Meteora liquidity pool](https://app.meteora.ag/pools/6t2CdBC26q9tj6jBwPzzFZogtjX8mtmVHUmAFmjAhMSn) along with 35,000 USDC
* 430 META issued as compensation to contributors

The DAO holds a practically infinite amount of META in its treasury. It can issue this META via the futarchic proposal process.
